## Chit Chat x Snip Cart Order Fulfillment

The workflow looks like this:

## Order Fulfillment Process:
1. For each order, we print 2 stickers:
  1. The Shipping Label from Chit Chats
  2. The packing slip

1. Before packing a single order, set up your batch. A batch is a box or bag of multiple orders that are dropped off at the shipper together. Either scan the code of an existing batch, or create a new batch.

1. If creating a new batch, print off the QR code for that batch and stick it to the batch box.

1. When we are ready to pack orders. We print off the Pending order labels.
1. An order needs to be assigned to a batch in Chit Chats, so scan the batch label to put you on the correct batch page.
1. Once you have packed an order, you must scan the order QR code, and this will do:
  1. Mark the package as being in that specific batch (Chit Chats)
  2. Mark the package as shipped in SnipCart. This will notify the customer that their order has shipped along with all tracking info.
